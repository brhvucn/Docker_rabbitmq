# Docker - RabbitMQ
This is a docker compose file that will start a docker version of RabbitMQ. The port 15672 (default RabbitMQ port) is mapped to the local port 15672. So that everything will still be working. This version of RabbitMQ has the management tools enabled.
To be able to administer the RabbitMQ please use the management tools located at http://localhost:15672 (as default based on the port mappings).
